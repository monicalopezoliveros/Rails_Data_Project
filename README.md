# Rails_Data_Project
This project is a simple car rental web application built with Rails. It allows users to view a list of available cars, navigate between pages with pagination, and search for specific cars. Each car has a detailed view with all relevant information, and users can access an About page explaining the ERD diagram. Data is generated using the Faker gem, and the menu provides easy navigation with links to the Home and About pages.
