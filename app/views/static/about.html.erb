        The Car Rental project is a web application that allows users to see the
        car list  availables to be rented. The data in this application comes from
        Faker as data sources.The data includes information on users, cars, and rentals.
        The database is structured in three main tables: Users, Cars, and Rentals.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> The Users table stores information such as the userâ€™s name, email, and password.</li>
        <li>The Cars table includes details about each car, like brand, model, year, and daily rental price.</li>
        <li>The Rentals table connects users with cars and stores information on rental start and end dates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These tables relate to each other through foreign keys, with each rental entry
        linking a user to a car. The database schema and relationships are shown in the
        ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) below.
